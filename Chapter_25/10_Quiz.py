# 1. What is significant about variables at the top level of a module whose names begin
# with a single underscore?
#
# Variables at the top level of  a module whose names begin with a single underscore are not copied
# out to the importing scope when the from *statement form is used. They can still be accessed by an
# import or the normal from statement form, though. The __all__ list is similar, but the logical
# converse; its contents are the only names that are copied out on a from *.
#
# 2. What does it mean when a module’s __name__ variable is the string "__main__"?
#
# If a module’s __name__ variable is the string "__main__", it means that the file is
# being executed as a top-level script instead of being imported from another file in
# the program. That is, the file is being used as a program, not a library. This usage
# mode variable supports dual-mode code and tests.
#
# 3. If the user interactively types the name of a module to test, how can your code
# import it?
#
# User input usually comes into a script as a string; to import the referenced module
# given its string name, you can build and run an import statement with exec, or pass
# the string name in a call to the __import__ or importlib.import_module.
#
# 4. How is changing sys.path different from setting PYTHONPATH to modify the module
# search path?
#
# Changing sys.path only affects one running program (process), and is temporary
# —the change goes away when the program ends. PYTHONPATH settings live in the
# operating system—they are picked up globally by all your programs on a machine,
# and changes to these settings endure after programs exit.
#
# 5. If the module __future__ allows us to import from the future, can we also import
# from the past?
#
# No, we can’t import from the past in Python. We can install (or stubbornly use)
# an older version of the language, but the latest Python is generally the best Python
# (at least within lines—see 2.X longevity!).
