# Test Your Knowledge: Part V Exercises
#
# See Part V in Appendix D for the solutions.
# 1. Import basics. Write a program that counts the lines and characters in a file (similar
# in spirit to part of what wc does on Unix). With your text editor, code a Python
# module called mymod.py that exports three top-level names:
# • A countLines(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number
# of lines in it (hint: file.readlines does most of the work for you, and len does
# the rest, though you could count with for and file iterators to support massive
# files too).
# • A countChars(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number
# of characters in it (hint: file.read returns a single string, which may be used
# in similar ways).
# • A test(name) function that calls both counting functions with a given input
# filename. Such a filename generally might be passed in, hardcoded, input with
# the input built-in function, or pulled from a command line via the sys.argv
# list shown in this chapter’s formats.py and reloadall.py examples; for now, you
# can assume it’s a passed-in function argument.
# All three mymod functions should expect a filename string to be passed in. If you
# type more than two or three lines per function, you’re working much too hard—
# use the hints I just gave!
# Next, test your module interactively, using import and attribute references to fetch
# your exports. Does your PYTHONPATH need to include the directory where you created
# mymod.py? Try running your module on itself: for example, test("mymod.py").
# Note that test opens the file twice; if you’re feeling ambitious, you may be able to
# improve this by passing an open file object into the two count functions (hint:
# file.seek(0) is a file rewind).
# 2. from/from *. Test your mymod module from exercise 1 interactively by using from to
# load the exports directly, first by name, then using the from * variant to fetch
# everything.
# 3. __main__. Add a line in your mymod module that calls the test function automatically
# only when the module is run as a script, not when it is imported. The line you
# add will probably test the value of __name__ for the string "__main__", as shown in
# this chapter. Try running your module from the system command line; then, import
# the module and test its functions interactively. Does it still work in both
# modes?
# 4. Nested imports. Write a second module, myclient.py, that imports mymod and tests
# its functions; then run myclient from the system command line. If myclient uses
# from to fetch from mymod, will mymod’s functions be accessible from the top level of
# myclient? What if it imports with import instead? Try coding both variations in
# myclient and test interactively by importing myclient and inspecting its __dict__
# attribute.
#
# 5 .Package imports. Import your file from a package. Create a subdirectory called
# mypkg nested in a directory on your module import search path, copy or move the
# mymod.py module file you created in exercise 1 or 3 into the new directory, and
# try to import it with a package import of the form import mypkg.mymod and call its
# functions. Try to fetch your counter functions with a from too.
# You’ll need to add an __init__.py file in the directory your module was moved to
# make this go, but it should work on all major Python platforms(that’s part of the
# reason Python uses “.” as a path separator).The package directory you create can
# be simply a subdirectory of the one you’re working in; if it is, it will be found
# via the home directory component of the search path, and you won’t have to configure
# your path.Add some code to your __init__.py, and see if it runs on each import.
#
# 6. Reloads. Experiment with module reloads: perform the tests in Chapter 23’s
# changer.py example, changing the called function’s message and/or behavior repeatedly,
# without stopping the Python interpreter. Depending on your system, you
# might be able to edit changer in another window, or suspend the Python interpreter
# and edit in the same window (on Unix, a Ctrl-Z key combination usually suspends
# the current process, and an fg command later resumes it, though a text edit window
# probably works just as well).
#
# 7. Circular imports. In the section on recursive (a.k.a. circular) import gotchas, importing
# recur1 raised an error. But if you restart Python and import recur2 interactively,
# the error doesn’t occur—test this and see for yourself. Why do you think
# it works to import recur2, but not recur1? (Hint: Python stores new modules in
# the built-in sys.modules table—a dictionary—before running their code; later imports
# fetch the module from this table first, whether the module is “complete” yet
# or not.) Now, try running recur1 as a top-level script file: python recur1.py. Do
# you get the same error that occurs when recur1 is imported interactively? Why?
# (Hint: when modules are run as programs, they aren’t imported, so this case has
# the same effect as importing recur2 interactively; recur2 is the first module imported.)
# What happens when you run recur2 as a script? Circular imports are uncommon
# and rarely this bizarre in practice. On the other hand, if you can understand
# why they are a potential problem, you know a lot about Python’s import semantics.
